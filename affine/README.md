Implementations are here. 
Finished: translation, homothetic transform, uniform scale, reflection, planar rotation. 
In-progress: Shear mapping with respect to a k-dimensional subspace W. 

### rref.py

Script to compute reduced row-echelon form of a given matrix. 

### preproecssing.py

Pretrained embedding preprocessing junk. 

### config.py

Transform config parameters (unfinished).
