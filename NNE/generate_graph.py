'''
Given NN data calculated from embedding samples (by nn_saver.py),
generates a node2vec-format k-NN graph as follows:
 (1) Every word (vocabulary index) becomes a node
 (2) For each neighbor v of node w: (w,v) is a directed edge in the graph

This script supports combining multiple nearest neighborhood files.
If multiple neighborhood files are provided as input, the following
changes are made in graph generation:
 - The neighbor sets of node w are unioned across all neighborhood samples
 - Each edge (w,v) is assigned weight 1/M, where M is the number of neighborhood
   sample files were v is a nearest neighbor of w.
